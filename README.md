# Prediction-of-Product-Sales
### The sales prediction analysis aims to provide actionable insights into the key factors that drive sales performance of food items across different store locations. By leveraging historical sales data, product attributes, and store characteristics, the model forecasts future sales and identifies trends that can help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.

### The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover the properties of both products and outlets that significantly influence sales volumes. These include variables such as product type, price, weight, visibility on shelves. At the outlet level, characteristics like store size, location type, store establishment year, and outlet type (grocery store, supermarket, etc.) are considered to determine their impact on consumer buying behavior.

### By understanding which combinations of product features and outlet attributes contribute most to high sales, the retailer can make more informed decisions around product placement, promotional planning, and supply chain management. This ultimately supports the goal of maximizing profitability and meeting consumer demand more effectively.
